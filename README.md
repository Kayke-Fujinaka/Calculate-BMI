> 🔎 Calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) with ease

## ⚔️ Challenge

In this challenge, you'll create a BMI calculator that takes in a person's weight and height and calculates their BMI. The application should have a front-end where the user can input their weight and height in either metric or imperial units. The back-end should calculate the BMI and display the result to the user, along with a corresponding message that indicates if the person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
